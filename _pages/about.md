<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am currently a Doctoral Researcher at the Centre for Wireless Communications (CWC) – Radio Technologies, University of Oulu, Finland, since January 2025. My main supervisor is [Markku Juntti](https://www.oulu.fi/en/researchers/markku-juntti), with [Nhan Nguyen](https://nhanng9115.github.io/homepage/) as my co-supervisor. I am a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Doctoral Fellow in the [EXACT-6G](https://www.exact6g.eu/) project, funded by the MSCA Doctoral Network (MSCA-DN) program.

Before joining the University of Oulu, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) under the guidance of [Zehui Xiong](https://sites.google.com/view/zehuixiong). I completed my Master’s degree in 2024 at Chung-Ang University (CAU), South Korea, under the supervision of [Sungrae Cho](https://sites.google.com/uclab.re.kr/srcho), with close collaboration from [Nhu-Ngoc Dao](https://pshhlab.github.io/). I received my Bachelor’s degree in 2020 from the Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST), Vietnam.

My research interests include deep reinforcement learning for wireless communications, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, cell-free massive MIMO, and multimedia streaming.
